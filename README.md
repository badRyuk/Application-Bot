# Application-Bot

Application bot was a small, easy to use bot. It was made solely for the purpose of only doing applications in [Dank Trades](discord.gg/trades). However, over time it was improved adding more commands to it. This bot only uses one package which is discord.js.

<br> 

Working with the bot is not hard at all. You just need to edit out your prefix, token, etc. Current prefix is ``+``. Start by using ``+help`` in case you haven't changed anything yet. Alright now, this isn't that kind of application bot which does everything on its own by which i mean you set questions for the bot to ask and it will collect responses for you and send it to you on a discord channel. This bot only sends google form links to the person via DM. Moreover it doesn't use a command handler so everything is just code and its completely messy. This was the only working instance of an application bot on github. I'm not sure if it still works now or not. While changing stuff is hard there isn't much you have to change only the form links that's it. Also the bot supported aliases as well so you have to change the form links for them as well (*well it was my first bot sorry*). This bot also has an autoreact feature so if a person is pinged the bot autoreacts! <br>
Alright now we didn't really use this feature in the server it was really intended to be used but you can get the application form responses in a specific channel. Its not a feature of the bot but using webhooks you can connect google forms to discord. For more info on how to do that please visit this repoistory [Google Forms to Discord](https://github.com/Iku/Google-Forms-to-Discord). The repoistory is not owned by me and I won't be providing much support for it rather than just helping a small bit. There are word limit as well so please limit the charecters on your google forms questions. The limit is set by discord for the number of charecters in a webhook field.

Thanks for viewing. Please feel free to open any issues or Pull Requests and also Star the project as well ⭐!

Alright! Bye Bye （*＾-＾*）
